This project focuses on analyzing **CO‚ÇÇ and other harmful gas emissions**. The main goal is to study how different factors impact these emissions and identify potential contributors. By conducting this analysis, we aim to gain a better understanding of the relationships between human activities and gas emissions.

### Objectives
- Analyze the impact of various factors on CO‚ÇÇ and other harmful gas emissions  
- Identify potential contributors to emissions  
- Develop insights into trends and correlations  
- Provide visualizations for better interpretation of results  
- Make predictions about future CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on identified trends and contributing factors  

### Expected Results
- Better understanding of the impact of various factors on CO‚ÇÇ and harmful gas emissions  
- Visualization tools that will allow a better understanding of the connections  

Global climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. CO‚ÇÇ emissions from fossil fuels and industrial processes are the leading contributors to global warming.  
We also provide **interactive tools** to visualize and understand emissions by country, sector, and economic indicators, with the goal of revealing actionable insights.

# Project overview
st.header("2. Project Overview")
st.markdown("""
In this project, our main goal is to analyze how much CO‚ÇÇ and other harmful gases are produced in **Europe**. We're especially interested in identifying which countries are the biggest polluters and which ones produce the least emissions, based on yearly data from **1970 to 2023**. This includes looking at both the total emissions and how they‚Äôve changed over time.

We also wanted to connect the data to **major global events**, such as:
- Epidemics (e.g., COVID-19 lockdowns)  
- Natural disasters  
- International agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol)  

Events like these tend to have a noticeable impact on human activity, which can clearly show up as sudden drops or increases in emissions. These patterns help us understand the real-world consequences of **policy changes, crises, or economic slowdowns**.

Another important part of our research is analyzing how different **economic sectors** contribute to emissions. We‚Äôre looking at industries such as:
- Transportation  
- Agriculture  
- Energy production  
- Manufacturing  

Some countries have higher emissions due to a strong industrial base, while others might have large agricultural sectors or heavy transport traffic. By breaking this down, we can highlight areas for improvement.

# Data and tools
st.subheader("2.1 Data and Tools")
st.markdown("""
Our datasets come from reputable sources including:
- **Eurostat**
- **EDGAR**
- **Kaggle** (filtered to include only reliable data)

We ensured quality by excluding unofficial datasets and supplementing missing countries. This allowed for a more **comprehensive and accurate** analysis across Europe.

In our analysis of climate change and international agreements, we correlated cumulative CO‚ÇÇ emissions with **global temperature change**. However, we did not account for the fact that around **50% of CO‚ÇÇ is absorbed by oceans and natural sinks**. Future analyses should include **carbon sink data** for improved accuracy.
